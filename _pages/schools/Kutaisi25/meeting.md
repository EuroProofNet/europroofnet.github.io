Will take place at Kutaisi International University, Kutaisi, Georgia, July 7th-11th 2025, organised by Besik Dundua and Nika Gagua.

### Aims

The School on Symbolic and Statistical Methods for Reasoning and Processing Formal Expressions aims to equip participants with advanced techniques for formal reasoning and expression processing. Covering topics such as access control policies, symbolic knowledge extraction, automated protocol analysis, and quantitative constraint solving, the program bridges symbolic and statistical approaches. It explores the integration of regular languages in deep learning and the use of runtime verification with SMT solving, providing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Through interdisciplinary learning, the school fosters research and innovation in formal methods and AI.

### Directions:

From Kutaisi International Airport, take a bus to the city center for around €4. Alternatively, you can take a taxi for about €10. From the city center to [Kutaisi International University](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kutaisi+International+University+%7C+Building+K+%7C/@42.2112127,42.7135331,17z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1skutaisi+international+university!3m6!1s0x405cedda7a2ef2d1:0xb65f0fc450dc07e6!8m2!3d42.213231!4d42.7154753!15sCiBrdXRhaXNpIGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwgdW5pdmVyc2l0eZIBCnVuaXZlcnNpdHngAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11hft0jt6k?entry=ttu), there is bus N3 where you can pursue ticket using credit/debit card.

You can also order a taxi directly from the airport to the university without going to the city center. For finding out public transport routes and schedules, you can use the Moovit app, or use taxi apps such as maxim and YandexGo
