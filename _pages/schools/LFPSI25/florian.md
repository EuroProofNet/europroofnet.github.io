**Lecturer:** [Florian Rabe](https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/)

In this course, I will show how the design and formalization of logics can apply the same modularity principles as commonplace in software design.
Using LF-like logical frameworks together with the [MMT](https://uniformal.github.io/) module system, we can define the syntax and proof theory as well as the semantics of translations between logics elegantly.

As concrete examples, the course will give a tour of the [LATIN logic atlas](https://gl.mathhub.info/MMT/LATIN2), which holds hundreds of modular building blocks for formal systems, organized multi-dimensionally by (among others)
- ontology: typed, soft-typed, untyped, ...
- type system features: functions, products, refinements, ...
- logical features: propositional, modal, first-order, higher-order, ...


**Outline (tentative):**

1. Introduction to LF and MMT, fundamental ontology and basic examples

2. The Zoo of Type-Theoretical and Logical Features

3. Homomorphisms for formalizing logic translations, semantics, and soundness proofs

4. Formalization limits of current frameworks: advanced type-theoretical features, completeness proofs, non-compositional translations
