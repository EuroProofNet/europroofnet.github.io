The aim of this WG is to contribute to the field of machine-learning-based
methods to improve the efficiency of automated theorem proving systems in terms
of further development of techniques for proof guidance and premise selection.
Furthemore, the group will explore how and to what extent tasks of
computer-assisted reasoning can be extended to proofs that are represented in
(controlled) natural languages.
### Goals 2024-2025
-  Share knowledge and discuss the results and perspectives on the use of large language models in proof systems
### Deliverables
-  Detailed technical report on the evaluation of techniques for learning proof search
guidance and premise selection in automated theorem provers.
    - [Learning Guided Automated Reasoning: A Brief Survey](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-61716-4_4) Lasse Blaauwbroek, David M. Cerna, Thibault Gauthier, Jan Jakubův, Cezary Kaliszyk, Martin Suda, Josef Urban, Logics and Type Systems in Theory and Practice 2024.
- White paper on including restricted natural language proof formats to existing proof libraries.
