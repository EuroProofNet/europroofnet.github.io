EuroProofNet can provide two kinds of grants:

- Short-Term Scientific Mission (STSM) -- see [past STSMs](../accepted_stsms)

- Inclusiveness Target Country Conference Grants (ITCG) -- see [past ITCGs](../accepted_itcgs)
  
**Upcoming deadlines**

- 24 November 2024: submission deadline for STSM and ITCG proposals between December 2024 and June 2025

**What is an ITCG?**

ITC Conference Grants are given to young (<= 40 years old at the time
of the conference) researchers affiliated in an [Inclusiveness Target
Country or Near Neighbour Country](../eligibility) to present a work
related to EuroProofNet in a high-level conference fully organized by
a third party, i.e. not organized nor co-organized by
EuroProofNet. Reimbursement rules are the same as for STSMs.

**What is an STSM?**

A Short-Term Scientific Mission (STSM) is a research visit of an individual researcher from a country participating in the Action in a different country also participating in the Action. We encourage STSMs as they are an effective way of starting and maintaining collaborations.

The procedure for proposing an STSM is described in [Annex 2 of the Annotated Rules](https://www.cost.eu/Annotated_Rules_for_COST_Actions_C#page=96).

The main points about STSMs are:

- Proposals should be submitted by the deadlines.
- An STSM must be between two different countries which are participating in the Action.
- The typical duration is one or two weeks. We favor short missions so that more people can get funded.
- A beneficiary of an STSM is reimbursed after his/her mission if the conditions below are satisfied.
- The total cost of the mission cannot exceed EUR 4000 (this is a hard limit).

**Eligibility**

Check the [eligibility rules](../eligibility) to know whether you can get an STSM.

**Reimbursement rules**

The beneficiary of an STSM will be reimbursed only of his/her travel
expenses plus a [daily allowance](../stsm-daily-allowance) depending
on the host country for each day of his/her stay, if the conditions
described [here](../reimbursement-rules) are satisfied. Therefore, the
amount awarded to a beneficiary of an STSM is only indicative and the
final amount will be based on reimbursement rules and receipts
available.

See [reimbursement rules](../reimbursement-rules) for more details.

**Documents to provide for STSMs**

Proposals must be made through the [e-COST system](https://e-services.cost.eu/activity/grants/add?type=STSM) (you need to add a bank account on your profile first). The following documents must be uploaded:

- The application form provided by e-COST which requires:
  - Details of the STSM (title and dates)
  - Goals of the STSM (max 200 words)
  - Working plan (max 500 words)
  - Expected outputs and contribution to the Action MoU [objectives and deliverables](../description) (max 500 words). Clearly indicate the main WG it contributes to.
- A letter from the host confirming that he or she will receive the applicant.
- A quote for the travel in euros (screen capture).

Be careful to check flight/train tickets that you
can modify or cancel for free or at little cost (possibly by taking
some insurance).

**Documents to provide for ITCGs**

Proposals must be made through the [e-COST system](https://e-services.cost.eu/activity/grants/add?type=ITCG) (you need to add a bank account on your profile first). The following documents must be uploaded:

- The application form provided by e-COST which requires:
  - Details of the conference (title and dates)
  - Details of the presentation (title, abstract)
  - Relevance wrt EuroProofNet [objectives](../description) (max 500 words)
  - Expected impact (max 500 words)
- Acceptance letter/mail from the conference organizers.
- A quote for the travel in euros (screen capture).
- The cost of the conference registration fees.

Be careful to check flight/train tickets that you
can modify or cancel for free or at little cost (possibly by taking
some insurance).

**Selection criteria**

The criteria according to which funding will be decided are in order:
- importance with regard to the research coordination objectives
- inclusiveness target countries
- age
- gender
- team with low resources
- balance over the action life time between people, teams, countries and working groups.

**Preparing your mission**

If your STSM proposal is accepted, you are responsible to buy the
necessary flight/train tickets and accommodation by yourself, at your
own name and address, as soon as possible to get the best price. Be
careful to take flight/train tickets and accommodations that you can
modify or cancel for free or at little cost (possibly by taking some
insurance).

The final price of your ticket should not be significantly bigger
(>10%) than the one given in your proposal. In case of significant
increase, you should ask confirmation from the
[chair](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) beforehand. Finally,
you should communicate the final cost of your flight or train ticket
to the [chair](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) as soon as
possible.

**Advance on mission costs**

This facility is not available at the moment.

**During your mission**

Keep your tickets and accommodation bills, as well as the receipts of
every meal (lunch and diner).

**Reimbursement rules**

To be reimbursed, a short scientific report, following this
[template](/_pages/STSM-report-template.docx), signed by the host must be
submitted through the e-cost system along with the travel tickets and
meal receipts, **within 2 weeks after the end of the STSM.** See the
[reimbursement rules](../reimbursement-rules) for more details.

**Date changes and cancelation**

In case you need to change the dates of an accepted STSM, you have to
inform the STSM coordinators as soon as possible and provide new dates
so that the STSM ends by the end of September.

In case you need to cancel an accepted STSM or ITCG, you need to inform the
STSM coordinators as soon as possible.

**Acknowledgements in publications**

In publications partly elaborated thanks to the STSM, you have to
[acknowledge](/_pages/Acknowledgment.pdf) EuroProofNet and COST as
follows: "This publication is based upon work from COST Action
EuroProofNet, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and
Technology, www.cost.eu)".

**More questions?**

For any question, please contact the two coordinators for STSMs: [Simona Prokić](http://imft.ftn.uns.ac.rs/simona/) (University of Belgrade, Serbia) **AND** [Ambrus Kaposi](http://akaposi.web.elte.hu) (Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary). Please, contact them both in case one is not available.

If you have questions concerning reimbursements, please contact
the [Grant Holder](mailto:saf-saclay-recettes@inria.fr).
