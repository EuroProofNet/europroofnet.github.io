### Getting to Genoa

[Genoa City Airport](https://www.airport.genova.it/en/transportation-airport-2/) is the most direct way to get to Genoa from abroad.
From there, the most common options to reach the city centre are:
* Volabus, a bus service to the city centre (10 euros, tickets can be bought on board with a card), or
* taxi services, with fixed fares to the two main train stations, Piazza Principe (7€ per person, min 21€) and Brignole (8€ per person, min 24€).

However there are not many direct flights to Genoa. Other good options, with many more flights, are the airports serving Milan ([Linate](https://www.milanolinate-airport.com/en), [Malpensa](https://www.milanomalpensa-airport.com/en), and [Orio al Serio](https://www.milanbergamoairport.it/en/)), [Pisa airport](https://www.pisa-airport.com/en/), and the [airport Nice Cote d'Azur](https://www.nice.aeroport.fr/en).
[Flixbus](https://global.flixbus.com) offers direct rides from all these airports to Genova Piazza Principe.
Alternatively, one can reach a train station in Milan, Pisa or Nice and continue with a train to Genoa.

Genoa has two main train stations, Piazza Principe (centre/west) and Brignole (east), with direct connections to Milan, Turin, and Pisa central train stations.
Almost all train services to/from Genoa are offered by [Trenitalia](https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html), except for one with Milan by [Italo](https://www.italotreno.com/en).
An InterCity train ride from Milan to Genoa takes about 1h45. From Pisa it takes about 2h30.
Train services from Nice to Genoa are not direct: one has to change train in Ventimiglia. The French part is served by [SNCF](https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en).

### Local transportation

Public transportation in Genoa is provided by [AMT](https://www.amt.genova.it/amt/).
The website is only in Italian, but the app for smartphones is also available in English ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.genova.amt.app), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/amt-genova/id1460252262)).

Note that it is _not_ possible to pay on board with credit card.
Tickets can be bought from newspapers shops and (some) tobacco shops, from the AMT app using a credit card, or using text messages and credit on your phone (that's old school).
Two options are available: 2€ for a ticket valid on metro, buses, lifts and funiculars, or 2.2€ for a ticket valid also on regional train services within the city (this excludes trains with mandatory reservation like InterCity).
One can buy 11 tickets for 20€ or 22€, respectively.

The workshop venue can be reached from Brignole train station with buses 15 and 43 (about 15 minutes ride).
The platform in front of the station serves buses going west.
There are three other platforms on the other side of the street:
the first one (from the station) serves buses going north,
the other two serve buses going (mostly) east.
Bus 43 stops at the second one, bus 15 leaves from the third one.
The nearest bus stop to the venue is Albaro/Causa.
