**Getting to Genoa**:
The airport of Genoa [Cristoforo Colombo]() is the most direct way to get to Genoa from abroad.
Genoa's airport is connected to the city centre with a bus called [Volabus]().
Taxi services have fixed fares to the two main train stations, Piazza Principe and Brignole:
| Brignole | 8€ per person, min 24€ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| P. Principe | 6€ per person, min 21€ |

However there are not many direct flights to Genoa. Other good options, with many more flights, are the airports serving Milan ([Linate](), [Malpensa](), and [Orio al Serio]()), the [Pisa airport](), and the [airport Nice Cote d'Azur]().
[Flixbus]() offers direct rides from all these airports to Genoa Piazza Principe.
Alternatively, these airports are connected (by bus) with central train stations.

Genoa has two main train stations, Piazza Principe (west) and Brignole (east), with direct conections to Milan and Pisa central train staions.
Most train services are offered by [Trenitalia](), but there are also few by [Italo]().
An InterCity train from Milan to Genoa takes about 1h45. From Pisa it takes about 2h30.
Train connections from Nice are less reliable and usually not direct.

**Local transportation**:
Public transportation in Genoa is provided by [AMT]().
Tickets can be bought from newspapers shops and (some) tobacco shops, from the AMT app using a credit card, or using text messages and credit on your phone (that's old school).
One can buy 10 tickets or weekly tickets for a discounted price.

The workshop venue can be reached from Brignole train station with buses 15 and 43 (about 10 minutes ride).
The first platform in front of the station serves buses going west.
There are three other platforms on the other side of the street:
the first one (from the staion) serves buses going North (valle del Bisagno),
the other two serve buses going east.
Bus 43 stops at the second one, bus 15 leaves from the third one.
