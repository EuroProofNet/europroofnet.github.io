**Dates:** 17-18 April 2025

**Place:** Genova, Italy

**Venue:**  
Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso,  
Scuola Politecnica, Università di Genova  
via Montallegro 1, Genova 16145  

<!--
⚠️⚠️ **On Thursday 17** all parks in Genoa will be closed due to strong wind. **The venue can be reached only through an entrance from viale Cambiaso**, more or less [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SFrJfeMmESh558zu7). You will have to enter a courtyard, reach the very end of it and turn right to a first flight of steps, then left to another flight of steps, and after those you will see the building. You will find some signs along the path. ⚠️⚠️

⚠️⚠️ Please beware of accommodation-related scam emails targeting this specific event.⚠️⚠️

Co-located with the [HoTT/UF 2025 Workshop](https://hott-uf.github.io/2025/).  

The aim of this meeting series is to bring together researchers working on the topics of [Working Group 6 of EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg6/). The main focus is thus on the syntax and semantics of type theory.
This includes, but is not limited to the goal of WG6:

> The aim of this WG is to develop a comprehensive theory of type theories, which (i) accounts for its domain-specific variants and the type theories currently used in proof assistants, and (ii) allows for the modular reasoning about their syntax and semantics.

The meeting will be in person with support for remote participation and is open to anyone interested in type theory. Talks can present published work or work in progress.
