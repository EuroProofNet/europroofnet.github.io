Co-located with the [HoTT/UF 2025 Workshop](https://hott-uf.github.io/2025/).  

The aim of this meeting series is to bring together researchers working on the topics of [Working Group 6 of EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg6/). The main focus is thus on the syntax and semantics of type theory.
This includes, but is not limited to the goal of WG6:

> The aim of this WG is to develop a comprehensive theory of type theories, which (i) accounts for its domain-specific variants and the type theories currently used in proof assistants, and (ii) allows for the modular reasoning about their syntax and semantics.

The meeting will be in person with support for remote participation and is open to anyone interested in type theory. Talks can present published work or work in progress.
