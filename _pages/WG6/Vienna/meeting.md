Co-located with the [HoTT/UF 2023 Workshop](https://hott-uf.github.io/2023/).

The aim of this meeting series is to bring together researchers working on the topics of [working group 6 of EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg6/). The main focus is thus on the syntax and semantics of type theory.

The programme will consist mainly of short talks, and plenty of time for discussion. The meeting will be in person and is open to anyone interested in type theory.
