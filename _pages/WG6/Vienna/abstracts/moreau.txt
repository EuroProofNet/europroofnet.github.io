Profinite lambda-terms and parametricity

This talk will present a definition of profinite lambda-terms of any simple type. Profinite structures naturally appear in automata theory as a way to speak about limiting behavior of finite words, giving rise to the notion of profinite word. At the same time, the Church encoding establishes a one-to-one correspondence between finite words and simply-typed lambda-terms, taken modulo beta and eta, of a type given by their finite alphabet. Our definition extends this correspondence between profinite lambda-terms of a Church type and profinite words over the associated alphabet. We start by introducing the set of profinite lambda-terms as a projective limit of finite sets of usual lambda-terms, considered modulo a notion of equivalence based on the finite standard model. We show that this resulting notion of profinite lambda-term, coming from Stone duality, lives in perfect harmony with the principles of Reynolds parametricity. Indeed, we prove a parametricity theorem for Church encodings of words, stating that every parametric family of elements in the finite standard model is the interpretation of a profinite lambda-term.
