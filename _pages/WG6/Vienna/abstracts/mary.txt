Workshop on implementing Kosta Dosenâ€™s categorial programming and sheaves: Cut-elimination in the double category of profunctors with J-rule-eliminated adjunctions.

There is now sufficient evidence (ref [6], [7]) that Kosta Dosen's ideas and techniques (ref [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]) could be implemented for proof-assistants, sheaves and applications; in particular cut-elimination, rewriting and confluence for various enriched, internal, indexed or double categories with adjunctions, monads, negation, quantifiers or additive biproducts; quantitative/quantum linear algebra semantics; presheaf/profunctor semantics; inductive-sheafification and sheaf semantics; sheaf cohomology and duality... It was difficult to discover the correct grammatical-formulation out of a dozen semantically-meaningful ones, but this ongoing implementation (ref [6]) should work in the next months.
