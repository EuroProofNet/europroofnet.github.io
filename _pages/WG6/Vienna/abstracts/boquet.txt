For the Metatheory of Type Theory, Internal Sconing Is Enough

I will present results obtained in joint work with Ambrus
Kaposi and Christian Sattler, written in the preprint
arXiv:2302.05190.

Metatheorems about type theories are often proven by interpreting the
syntax into models constructed using categorical gluing. We propose to
use only sconing (gluing along a global section functor) instead of
general gluing. The sconing is performed internally to a presheaf
category, and we recover the original glued model by externalization.

Our method relies on constructions involving two notions of models:
first-order models (with explicit contexts) and higher-order models
(without explicit contexts). Sconing turns a displayed higher-order
model into a displayed first-order model.

Using these, we derive specialized induction principles for the syntax
of type theory. The input of such an induction principle is a
boilerplate-free description of its motives and methods, not
mentioning contexts. The output is a section with computation rules
specified in the same internal language. We illustrate our framework
by proofs of canonicity, normalization and syntactic parametricity for
type theory.
