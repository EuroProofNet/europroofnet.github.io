Title: Generic pattern unification: a categorical approach
Abstract. We provide a generic categorical setting for Miller's pattern unification. The syntax with metavariables is generated by a free monad applied to finite coproducts of representable functors; the most general unifier is computed as a coequaliser in the associated multisorted Lawvere theory. Our setting handles simply typed second-order syntax, linear syntax, or (intrinsic) polymorphic syntax such as system F. This is a joint work with Neel Krishnaswami.
