The aim of this meeting series is to bring together researchers working on the topics of [working group 6 of EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg6/). The main focus is thus on the syntax and semantics of type theory.
This includes, but is not limited to the goal of WG6:

> The aim of this WG is to develop a comprehensive theory of type theories, which (i) accounts for its domain-specific variants and the type theories currently used in proof assistants, and (ii) allows for the modular reasoning about their syntax and semantics.

The programme will consist mainly of short talks and plenty of time
for discussion. The meeting will be in person and is open to anyone
interested in type theory. Talks can expose published work or work in
progress. Submissions of open questions and topics to be discussed
collectively are also welcome: please use the same form and clearly mark your
entry as a discussion proposal, we will try to organize a few short discussion sessions.
