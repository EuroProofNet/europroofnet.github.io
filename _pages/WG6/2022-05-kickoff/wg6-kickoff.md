The workshop will bring together researchers on the topics of [working group 6](/wg6), to share recent results, and co-ordinate future research, including collaboration towards deliverables.

The programme will consist primarily of short talks, with plenty of time for discussion.  On the Sunday after the workshop, there will be an informal social excursion — details TBA.
