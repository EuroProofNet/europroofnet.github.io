The aim of this WG is twofold:
- to lower the computational complexity and increase expressiveness of techniques for the verification of program
correctness,
- to strengthen synergies and interoperability between different proof systems, to combine the benefits of the different methodologies
underlying the proof systems, and to facilitate formal verification of both software
and mathematics.

### Documents and Deliverables

We use a [git repository](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ProgramVerification) to store all our documents and deliverables. In particular, we initiated an 
[inventory of program verification tools](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ProgramVerification/wiki).
