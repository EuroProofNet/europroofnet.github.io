This will be the final meeting of the WG2 and the [International Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems](https://jakobnordstrom.se/WHOOPS25/) (WHOOPS'25). It is part of the [Final EuroProofNet Symposium](https://europroofnet.github.io/Symposium/).

**Date:** Thursday 11th to Saturday 13th (WG2), Saturday 13th and Sunday 14th (WHOOPS'25)

**Venue:**  [Institut Pascal](https://www.institut-pascal.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), 530 Rue André Rivière, 91400 Orsay [[access]](../Access) [[hotels]](../Hotels) [[food options]](../Food)

**Organizers** [Mathias Fleury](https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/fleury/) and [Sophie Tourret](https://members.loria.fr/sophie.tourret/)

**Registration:** fill in this [form](https://forms.gle/QLFzh3Ugv5WgkhZr7) (registration is free but mandatory)

**Talks** If you want to give a talk, please send an email to [Mathias Fleury](https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/fleury/)

**Objective:** The aim of this meeting series is to bring together researchers working on the topics of [working group 2 of EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2/). Our work focuses on two topics: Our first aim is to work and improve automated theorem provers. Our second aim is to make them correct by improving proof logging -- both in an attempt to produce short proofs but also to work on proof formats that support many features instead of having one format for each required feature. Proof logging is an important topic, as it makes it possible to check the work of a solver without trusting it. Our third aim is to translate proofs via the Dedukti proof system.

The program will be composed of talks and sessions to work alone or in small groups on the development of tools for automated theorem proving and proofs (in particular Dedukti proofs), taking advantage of the participation of experts on Dedukti, formula and proof exchange standards, and theorem provers and solvers, and to make progress on EuroProofNet objectives and deliverables.

**Program** Preliminary version:

Please note that you have to organize yourself for lunches (and dinners), but there are many [[options]](../Food) around.
