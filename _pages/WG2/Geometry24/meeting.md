**Organizer:**  [Pedro Quaresma](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~pedro/)

**Date:** 28-30 May 2024

Remark: the official dates of the meeting taken into account for reimbursements are from 28 to 30 of May (3 days). However, since most people will arrive on the 27th and leave on the 31st, the program includes two optional work sessions on those days (afternoon and morning).

**Venue:** [Hôtel Restaurant Campanile Nice Aéroport, Nice, France](https://nice-aeroport.campanile.com/fr-fr/) 459-461 Promenade Des Anglais L'arénas 06200 Nice, France

**How to get there?** Hotel Campanile Nice Airport is 300m away from the airport.

**Program:** Different geometry systems, including axiomatic developments, school-level geometry, and automated theorem provers use a range of primitive axioms or "rules". Preparing a meta-prover capable of dealing with and merging different sets of rules, specified in TPTP-FOL, formally verified to be consistent, with natural languages and geometric renderings and capable to be integrated in an array of educational system, such as dynamic geometry system is a milestone goal.

**Objectives/Deliverables:**

* The construction/formal verification of the set of
   rules.

* The construction of rule based provers

*  Integration of the provers in DGS(s), with  natural and geometric renderings.

**Registered participants:**

Alexander Vujic, Anna Petiurenko,Jelena Marković, Julien Narboux, Nicolas Magaud, Nuno Baeta, Pedro Quaresma, Piotr Błaszczyk, Vesna Marinković, Zoltán Kovács
