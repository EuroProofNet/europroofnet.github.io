**Organizer:**  [Pedro Quaresma](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~pedro/)

**Date:** 28-30 May 2024

Remark: the official dates of the meeting taken into account for reimbursements are from 28 to 30 of May (3 days). 

**Venue:** [Hôtel Restaurant Campanile Nice Aéroport, Nice, France](https://nice-aeroport.campanile.com/fr-fr/) 459-461 Promenade Des Anglais L'arénas 06200 Nice, France

**How to get there?** Hotel Campanile Nice Airport is 300m away from the airport.

**Program:** Different geometry systems, including axiomatic developments, school-level geometry, and automated theorem provers use a range of primitive axioms or "rules". Preparing a meta-prover capable of dealing with and merging different sets of rules, specified in TPTP-FOL, formally verified to be consistent, with natural languages and geometric renderings and capable to be integrated in an array of educational system, such as dynamic geometry system is a milestone goal.

**Objectives/Deliverables:**

* The construction/formal verification of the set of
   rules.

* The construction of rule based provers

*  Integration of the provers in DGS(s), with  natural and geometric renderings.

**Registered participants:**

Alexander Vujic, Anna Petiurenko,Jelena Marković, Julien Narboux, Pierre Boutry, Nuno Baeta, Pedro Quaresma, Piotr Błaszczyk, Vesna Marinković, Zoltán Kovács. Thierry Dana-Picard also join the group (extra-registry).
