## Situation Summary by Frédéric

[slides](summary.pdf)

-   One new country: Bosnia and Herzegovina
-   Good evolution in the number of members
-   Fewer talks recorded this year
-   Budget: STSMs and ICTGs largest expense. Sometimes less money spent
    than planned, so more events could be funded. Now full budget spent.
-   Reimbursement: before September only LOS missing. Since September,
    not fully reimbursed yet but many checked. Reimbursements should be done in the coming month.
