The aim of this WG is to develop a comprehensive theory of type theories, which
(i) accounts for its domain-specific variants and the type theories currently
used in proof assistants, and (ii) allows for the modular reasoning about their
syntax and semantics.

### Activities

* May 2022: kickoff meeting on syntax and semantics, Stockholm University, Sweden
