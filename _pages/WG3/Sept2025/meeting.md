**Meeting description:**

This WG3 meeting will consist of a three-day meeting allowing members of the software formal verification community to share their work on the objectives and deliverables of WG3. More specifically, we aim to

 * get an overview of the challenges identified in which proof systems can be applied to face them, and to propose a summary of recipes for verifying them,
 * deepen on techniques for for syntax-semantics interfaces for program verification
 * share advances on inference techniques of specifications as helpers
 * deepen on the comparison of the approaches used in the international verification competitions (SV-COMP, TermComp,etc.) 

The program will be composed of talks and discussion sessions on these topics, taking advantage of the participation of experts on verification and proof systems.
