This will be the final meeting of the EuroProofNet Working Group 3 on Program Verification. It is part of the [Final EuroProofNet Symposium](https://europroofnet.github.io/Symposium/).

**Date:** 17-19 September 2025

**Venue:**  [Institut Pascal](https://www.institut-pascal.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), 530 Rue André Rivière, 91400 Orsay [[access]](../Access) [[hotels]](../Hotels) [[food options]](../Food)

**Organizers:** [Adrián Riesco](https://maude.sip.ucm.es/~adrian/), [Alicia Villanueva](https://personales.upv.es/alvilga1/)

**Meeting description:**

This WG3 meeting will consist of a three-day meeting allowing members of the software formal verification community to share their work on the objectives and deliverables of WG3. More specifically, we aim to

 * get an overview of the challenges identified in which proof systems can be applied to face them, and to propose a summary of recipes for verifying them,
 * deepen on techniques for for syntax-semantics interfaces for program verification
 * share advances on inference techniques of specifications as helpers
 * deepen on the comparison of the approaches used in the international verification competitions (SV-COMP, TermComp,etc.) 

The program will be composed of talks and discussion sessions on these topics, taking advantage of the participation of experts on verification and proof systems.
