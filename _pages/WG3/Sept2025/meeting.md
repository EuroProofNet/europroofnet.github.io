**Program:**

This WG3 meeting will consist of a three-day meeting allowing members of the software formal verification community to share their work on the objectives and deliverables of WG3. More specifically, we aim to

 * get an overview of the challenges identified in which proof systems can be applied to face them, and to propose a summary of recipes for verifying them,
 * deepen on techniques for for syntax-semantics interfaces for program verification
 * share advances on inference techniques of specifications as helpers
 * deepen on the comparison of the approaches used in the international verification competitions (SV-COMP, TermComp,etc.) 

The program will be composed of talks and discussion sessions on these topics, taking advantage of the participation of experts on verification and proof systems.

**Objectives:**

The meeting aims to:

  * bring together members of the different communities, 
  * identify and share verification challenges with recipes,
  * celebrate results that advance the state of the art in the context of the WG3 goals and deliverables,
  * transfer knowledge in terms of expertise and scientific tools across the different disciplines and between academia and industry, and
  * foster collaborations and build synergies among participants to ease the path to more fruitful results beyond the end of the Action.
