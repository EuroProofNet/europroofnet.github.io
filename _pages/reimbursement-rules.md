Participants invited at a meeting or school, and people having an approved STSM, are reimbursed only of their travel, accommodation and meal expenses according to the following rules.

- Participants must be [eligible](../eligibility).

- Participants must have received an invitation from the e-cost system and must have accepted it within 2 weeks after reception.

- Master students must provide a registration certificate of their university.

- Participants must book their flight/train/bus and accommodation by themself as much in advance as possible to get good prices, together with insurance in case of cancelation. They must choose the most economical means of transportation. First-class tickets are not allowed. Taxis are not reimbursed. In any case, the reimbursement for travel costs is limited to 1500 euros.

- Participants can use their own car if it is less expensive than using flight/train/bus, especially for a group. The reimbursement is around 0.35 euros/km for the driver (ask the precise amount to the Grant Holder). On the other hand, parking, fuel, toll and car rental are not reimbursed.

- Participants must provide the Grant Holder with the **tickets and bills** of their travel and accommodation (at their name and address), and the **receipts of their meals** (lunch and dinner). In the event there are no receipts, the reimbursement will not be possible. These documents are necessary for making sure that the reimbursement is justified but the amount of the reimbursement is a fixed daily allowance (see more details below).

**Additional rules for meetings and schools:**

- Participants must sign the attendance sheets during the meeting (only the days spent at the meeting are reimbursed).

- For accommodation, meals and travels <=100km, the reimbursement is a daily flat rate fixed by the core group (usually around 120 euros/day depending on the country). Ask the precise amount from the organizers of the event.

**Additional rules for STSMs:**

- STSM grantees must upload on the COST website their report, signed by their host, once the final amount of their STSM has been approved.

- For accommodation, meals and local transport, the reimbursement is a [daily flat rate](../stsm-daily-allowance) fixed by the Grant Holder depending on the host country. About 2/3 of the flat rate is for the hotel, 1/6 for the lunch and 1/6 for the diner. Be careful that a lunch or diner will not be reimbursed if there is no receipt for it (see details below). Receipts from markets or supermarkets are accepted.

- **Before the travel:**

  The current Grant Holder cannot use the bank details entered on the COST platform. It is imperative to send the following information to Aissatou DIALLO (aissatou-sadio.diallo@inria.fr):
    * Your full name (first and last name)
    * Your place and date of birth
    * Your address
    * The name of your current university
    * An official document from your bank or one or several screen captures where we can find: your name, IBAN, Swift code, name and address of your bank. Each of these details is essential for the reimbursement of your expenses.

  If you have already sent this information for a previous meeting AND if it has not changed since then, there is no need to resend it.

- **During the travel:**

  Bank card receipts without tickets are NOT accepted.

  Keep all the receipts and tickets, in order to be reimbursed for your transport, accommodation and meal expenses, according to the following rules:

    * Transport expenses will be paid according to your real expenses, on presentation of the transport invoice in your name with details of dates, times and place of transport. Proof of travel in the form of boarding passes, train tickets or toll tickets is mandatory.

    * Accommodation expenses will be paid in the form of an accommodation allowance (65% of daily allowance) on presentation of the accommodation invoice in your name. 

    * Meal expenses will be paid in the form of a meal allowance (35% of daily allowance) for lunch (17,5%) and for dinner (17,50%), according to the following rules: 

         - One meal allowance for lunch and one meal allowance for dinner / day (lunch must be purchased between 10am and 3pm. / dinner must be purchased after 6pm.)
         - Breakfasts are NOT eligible for reimbursement.
         - If you prefer to buy some food in a supermarket, keep the tickets (the dates and times must be visible), and precise us the dates and meals concerned.
