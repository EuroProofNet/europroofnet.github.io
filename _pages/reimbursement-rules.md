Participants invited at a meeting or school, and people having an approved ITCG, are reimbursed only of their travel, accommodation and meal expenses according to the following rules:

- Participants must be [eligible](../eligibility).

- Participants must have received an invitation from the e-cost system and must have accepted it within 2 weeks after reception.

- Master students must provide a registration certificate of their university.

- Participants must book their flight/train/bus and accommodation by themself as much in advance as possible to get good prices, together with insurance in case of cancelation. They must choose the most economical means of transportation. First-class tickets are not allowed. Taxis are not reimbursed. In any case, the reimbursement for travel costs is limited to 1500 euros.

- Participants can use their own car if it is less expensive than using flight/train/bus, especially for a group. The reimbursement is 0.35 euros/km for the driver, with 1000 km maximum (parking, fuel, toll and car rental are not reimbursed). To be reimbursed, one must provide a **parking ticket or bill**, or an attestation of the hotel.

- Participants must provide the Grant Holder with the **tickets and bills** of their travel and accommodation (at their name and address). In the event there are no receipt, the reimbursement will not be possible. These documents are necessary for making sure that the reimbursement is justified but the amount of the reimbursement is a fixed daily allowance (see more details below).

- In case of shared hotel room, the person whose name is on the bill receives a full daily allowance, and the other persons receive 40% of the daily allowance.

- For meetings and schools, participants must sign the attendance sheet (only the days spent at the meeting are reimbursed).

- For accommodation, meals and travels <=100km, the reimbursement is a daily flat rate fixed by the core group (usually around 160 euros/day depending on the country). Ask the precise amount to the organizers of the event.

**Additional rules for ITCGs:**

- ITCG beneficiaries must send to the [chair](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) and the [grant awarding coordinator](http://imft.ftn.uns.ac.rs/simona/) a report following this [template](/_pages/ITCG-report-template.docx) **within two weeks maximum after the end of the ITCG**.

- The accommodation and meals are reimbursed according to a [daily flat rate](../itcg-daily-allowance) fixed by the Grant Holder depending on the host country. 2/3 of the flat rate is for the hotel, 1/6 for the lunch and 1/6 for the diner.

- Once the report is approved and the final amount computed, ITCG beneficiaries receive a mail asking them to upload on the COST website their report.

**Before the travel:**

  The current Grant Holder will contact you a few weeks before the meeting asking you the following information:
    * Full name (first and last name)
    * Place and date of birth
    * Address
    * The name of your university or company
    * An official document from your bank or one or several screen captures where we can find: your name, IBAN, Swift code, name and address of your bank. Each of these details is essential for the reimbursement of your expenses.

  If you have already sent this information for a previous meeting AND if it has not changed since then, there is no need to resend it.

**During the travel:**

  Keep all the receipts and tickets of your transports and accommodations:

    * Transport expenses will be reimbursed according to your real expenses on presentation of the transport invoice in your name with details of dates, times and place of transport. Proof of travel in the form of boarding passes, train tickets or toll tickets is mandatory.

    * Accommodation expenses will be reimbursed in the form of an accommodation allowance (65% of daily allowance) on presentation of the accommodation invoice in your name.

    * Meal expenses will be paid in the form of a meal allowance for lunch (17,50% of daily allowance) and for dinner (17,50% of daily allowance).

**After the travel:**

  In order to be reimbursed readily, send all the travel documents and proofs of payments as soon as possible after your mission.
