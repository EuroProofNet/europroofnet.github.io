**Participants (15):**

- [Frédéric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) fixed small bugs and made improvements in [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) ([943](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/943), [944](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/944), [949](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/949), [950](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/950), [952](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/952), [953](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/953), [954](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/954)) and developed a new translator from [HOL-Light](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/) to Dedukti and Lambdapi based on a fork of HOL-Light: see [dk branch](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol-light/tree/dk).

- [Thiago Felicissimo](http://www.lsv.fr/~felicissimo/) coded a prototype implementation of CompLF (Computational Logical Framework, name subject to change), a logical framework in the tradition of Dedukti whose full definition and metatheoretical study is still a work in progress. Like Dedukti, CompLF is a framework for defining type theories whose definitional equality is purely computational, in the sense that it is purely generated by rewrite rules. It refines Dedukti by incorporating canonical forms (as in Canonical LF) and erased arguments, allowing for a strong syntactic correspondence with commonly used non-annotated syntaxes. Because erasing arguments from the syntax can jeopardize decidability of typechecking, CompLF theories can be polarized by assigning modes to their symbols and their non-erased arguments. Terms written in these polarized theories can then be typechecked through a (theory agnostic) bidirectional typing algorithm. This algorithm is the one implemented in the prototype, which has been successfully tested with a small test suite. The next steps are to further test the implementation and conclude the metatheoretical study of CompLF.

- Yoan Géran worked on a tool to translate proofs from a Dedukti encoding of the Predicate logic to the tactic language of Coq. He used it to translate the [proofs of the first book of Euclid](https://github.com/Karnaj/plth_geocoq_euclid) (from the Geocoq library) to [Coq](https://github.com/Karnaj/dktactgeo). The result is more readable than the one obtained previously using the [export from STTFA](https://github.com/Karnaj/sttfa_geocoq_euclid).

- [Julien Narboux](https://dpt-info.di.unistra.fr/~narboux/) and [Predrag Janičić](http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~janicic/) developed with the help of Artur Korniłowicz support for exporting proofs from their coherent logic prover called [Larus](https://github.com/janicicpredrag/Larus) to the proof assistant Mizar. Julien Narboux and Yohan Geran discussed the transformation of proofs into coherent logic form, the generation of tactic based proofs from predicate logic and the integration of the GeoCoq library into Logipedia.

- [Emilie Grienenberger](http://www.lsv.fr/~grienenberger/): [HOLLightToDk](https://github.com/Deducteam/HOLLightToDk)

- [Claudio Sacerdoti Coen](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sacerdot/) and
[Enrico Tassi](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Enrico.Tassi/) patched
CoqInE to export type-class related information to Dedukti file
(i.e. what symbols are typeclass declaration/instantces); wrote bash
scripts to translate the CoqInE output to Lambdapi; embedded
[Elpi](https://github.com/LPCIC/elpi) into Lambdapi (see
[PR#418](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/418)) and used it
to automatically find instances of type-classes, both natively and up
to the encoding used in CoqInE. They also documented how to export
Isabelle files not in the standard library to Lambdapi, with the aim
of enriching the output with type class related annotations.

- Thomas Traversié worked on the elimination of the user-defined rewriting rules in a Dedukti theory. Such a transformation is done by replacing these rewriting rules with axioms. The main difficulty is to handle the different possible translations of a term, depending on where the rewriting rules are applied. He started to implement this technique.

- [Simon Guilloud](https://people.epfl.ch/simon.guilloud) and [Amélie Ledein](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/Perso/AmelieLedein) have implemented Sequent Calculus inside Lambdapi. They have explored variants of FOL where conjunctions and disjunctions are represented as lists and the possibility of using Lambdapi's rewrite system to compute partial normal forms of formulas. They also have started a reduction of the Sequent Calculus system to Natural Deduction and lambda calculus (using Curry-Howard).

- Claude Stolze finished implementing a translator from [Atelier B](https://www.atelierb.eu/) proof obligations (in POG format) to Lambdapi. 5387 POG files (5.7 GiB) have been processed and the resulting Lambdapi files have been typechecked successfully. This will be the basis for proving these proof obligations using external tools.

- [Artur Korniłowicz](http://math.uwb.edu.pl/~arturk/) worked on a
tool for the fully automatic translation of definitions and statements
(theorems, schemas, registrations, and reductions) collected in the
[Mizar](http://mizar.org/) Mathematical Library into Lambdapi.  The
first result is the translation of definitions and statements
involving notions without hidden arguments.  He also cooperated on the
export of Larus proofs into the Mizar proof assistant.

- Gabriel Hondet documented the exporter [personoj](https://github.com/Deducteam/personoj) (PVS to Dedukti) planning for a new release. He provided a quickstart guide, how-to guides to run the test suites and to check the output of personoj, and additional notes for developers of personoj. He also contributed to [STTfaXport](https://github.com/Deducteam/sttfaxport) and released an [initial beta version](https://github.com/Deducteam/sttfaxport/releases/tag/20230131). He also documented a feature of [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) (https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/commit/7f1da661a9899f1d4f7a98ecf1619fc612eaa042) and discussed a revised API for Dedukti with François Thiré.

- François Thiré worked on dkcheck, dkmeta, and universo, to make them
robust and easier to interact with (in particular to get a modular
proof exporter of the Isabelle proofs encoded into the STTfa
logic). The main task was to provide users with an API that is safe
and convenient. This work led to a new API which is better (especially
regarding safety) and with less side-effects. This should help the
future developments of interoperability projects using the Dk tools
API. In particular, this should ease the integration with
[STTfaxport](https://github.com/Deducteam/sttfaxport), a tool to
export proofs from the logic STTfa to various proof systems.
