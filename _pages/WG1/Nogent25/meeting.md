**Organizer:** [Frédéric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)

**Date:** 11-13 February 2025

**Venue:** <a href="https://www.hotel-beaurivage-nogentsurseine.com/">Hôtel Beau Rivage</a>, 20 rue de Villiers aux Choux 10400 Nogent-sur-Seine, France

**How to get there?** There are direct trains from Paris Gare de l'Est to Nogent-sur-Seine (for instance 09:42-10:38 and 11:42-12:40), and from Nogent-sur-Seine to Paris Gare de l'Est (for instance 14:20-15:16 and 15:20-16:19). The hotel is a 20-minutes walk from the train station.

**Program:** The goal is to discuss logic encodings and proof translation tools, taking advantage of the participation of experts on various languages and tools, to make progress on EuroProofNet [objectives](../objectives) and [deliverables](../deliverables).

**Cost:** The cost of accommodation and meals is about 160 euros/day/person. Participants have to make a bank transfer of half of the cost to <a href="https://www.hotel-beaurivage-nogentsurseine.com/">Hôtel Beau Rivage</a> in order to confirm their participation, and send a mail to aubeaurivage@wanadoo.fr and Frédéric Blanqui, with subject "EuroProofNet seminar 10-14 February 2025", to inform us of the bank transfer. The second half will have to be paid at the hotel. It is possible to be reimbursed of the first half if the hotel is informed of the cancellation before January 27.

**Participants (18):** Frédéric Blanqui, Rishikesh Vaishnav, Melanie Taprogge, Théo Winterhalter, Anne Grieu, Alessio Coltellacci, Thomas Traversié, Ciaran Dunne, Claudio Sacerdoti Coen, Gabriel Hondet, Abdelghani Alidra, Jérémy Dubut, Bruno Barras, Michael Färber, Olivier Hermant, Nicolas Margulies, Catherine Dubois, Guillaume Burel

- [Frédéric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) added new proof tactics in Lambdapi ([1194](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/1194), [1195](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/1195)) and, together with Rishikesh Vaishnav, started to translate HOL-Light to Lean, by extending Lambdapi ([1197](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/1197)) and Hol2dk ([173](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk/pull/173)).
- [Rishikesh Vaishnav](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/Perso/RishVaishnav) finished writing his paper on [Lean4Less](https://github.com/rish987/Lean4Less) and collaborated with Frédéric Blanqui on the translation from HOL-Light to Lean. He also started work on addressing the scaling issues faced by Lean4Less by attempting an alternate translation implementation that uses proof by reflection, rather than explicitly constructed proof terms.
- [Michael Färber](https://gedenkt.at/) gave a talk about [jaq](https://github.com/01mf02/jaq) and [Typst](https://typst.app/). He also worked with Gabriel Hondet on a redesign of the [Pratter](https://forge.tedomum.net/koizel/pratter) API (resulting in version v5.0) and helped with the integration of this new version into Lambdapi ([1196](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/pull/1196)). Furthermore, he worked on a prototype of XML support for jaq. Finally, he worked together with Nicolas Margulies on a new approach using lambda calculus for [denotational semantics for the jq language](https://github.com/01mf02/jq-lang-spec).
- [Thomas Traversié](https://thomastraversie.github.io/) worked on translation mechanisms to exchange proofs between Dedukti theories, by extending theory morphisms and logical relations from LF to Dedukti. This work will be continued during his STSM hosted by Florian Rabe.
- Melanie Taprogge continued her ongoing work on implementing the Lambdapi output of the HOL ATP Leo-III by evaluating the coverage of the current proof encoding using the TPTP problem library. She then improved and extended the implementation accordingly.
- [Jérémy Dubut](https://jeremydubut.com) worked on the alignement of functions on natural numbers (even, odd, factorial, ...) between HOL light and Coq, as well as on a profiler to check the time required to build each proof in an Isabelle theory.
