The aim of this WG is to promote the output of detailed, checkable proofs from
automated theorem provers. Work is under way for FOL/HOL theorem provers and
SMT solvers, but the expressivity of their input languages renders the task
significantly more complicated than e.g., in the propositional SAT world, with
a higher need of coordination.

### Documents and Deliverables

We use a [git repository to store all our documents and deliverables](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ATP).  In particular, we initiated [an inventory](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ATP/wiki) of
* automated theorem provers producing proofs
* proof formats
* checking tools for these proof formats.
