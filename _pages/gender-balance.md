In the area of computer science, the proportion of women researchers is much lower than the number of male researchers: the European Commission [She Figures 2021 report](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-law-and-publications/publication-detail/-/publication/67d5a207-4da1-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1) indicates that among doctoral graduates in computer science there is about 21% of women (Table 2.4) and the proportion drops when progressing towards Grade A positions (Table 6.2, Figure 6.2). In the EuroProofNet there is currently about 20% women participants and about 35% in the management committee, therefore higher than the baseline. This reflects our active efforts to improve representation of women in the leadership roles.

We strive to ensure better gender balance in the community and we take actions towards this goal. We are working with the cost action CA19122 [European Network For Gender Balance in Informatics (EUGAIN)](https://eugain.eu/) and we implement some of the [best practices](https://eugain.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EUGAIN_booklet_2022-05.pdf) from the EUGAIN booklet:

- We are committed to using inclusive language.
- We monitor the distribution of funds among action participants and we prioritize funding of people of underrepresented genders.
- We monitor gender balance within the management roles.
- We contact eligible women researchers and invite them to join the action.
- We promote work done by members of underrepresented genders ([WEPN'22](../women-epn-2022/), [WEPN'23](../women-epn-2023/)).
- We organize training and discussion on unconscious biases and gender-balance issues ([WEPN'22](../women-epn-2022/), [WEPN'23](../women-epn-2023/)).
- We aid parents with finding/ensuring childcare at the events organized by EuroProofNet action.
- We consider gender aspects of our research.

If you are organizing an event within the action or if you have other questions/ideas about how to address gender-balance issues within the action, contact the [gender-balance coordinator](../contact).
