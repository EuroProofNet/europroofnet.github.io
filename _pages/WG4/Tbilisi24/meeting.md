<!--Post-processing Coq Proof Scripts to Make Them More Robust, Titouan Lozac’h and Nicolas Magaud: Proof assistants like Coq are increasingly popular to help mathematicians carry out proofs of the results they conjecture. However, formal proofs remain highly technical and are especially difficult to reuse. In this paper, we present a framework to carry out a posteriori script transformations. These transformations are meant to be applied as an automated post-processing step, once the proof has been completed. We implemented two transformations so far:  the first one takes an arbitrary large proof script and produces an equivalent single-line proof script, which can be executed by Coq in one single step. 
The second example implements the converse operation, fully expanding a proof script into atomic proof steps. Other applications can be envisioned : removing all named hypotheses, increasing automation, removing some pre-defined proof patterns, etc. We apply our tool to various Coq proof scripts, including rather large ones from the GeoCoq library.-->

<!--Verifying Nominal Equational Reasoning Modulo Algorithms, Mauricio Ayala-Rincón: The PVS library on nominal equational reasoning includes
formalizations of syntactic unification and the formalization of the
long-standing Stikel(-Fages) AC-unification algorithm. Our research on
nominal equational reasoning has uncovered significant disparities
compared to the first-order unification approach. Specifically, it has
highlighted differences in the unification type of nominal unification
modulo regarding first-order standard unification. The talk will
deeply delve into the mechanization of various unification algorithms
in the PVS nominal library, focusing on nominal equality-check,
matching, and unification modulo associativity and commutativity, in
order to emphasize the observed differences, address pertinent
questions, and present the current progress on the mechanization of
anti-unification modulo algorithms.-->

<!--Exploring the benefits of a general abstract formalization, Thaynara Arielly de Lima: One of the main challenges in formal methods is the reuse of formal
proofs in several contexts.  With this in mind, the recent PVS
developments regarding abstract algebra have been mechanized as
generally as possible, allowing their application to different
algebraic structures. For example, recently, a Euclidean gcd algorithm
for Euclidean domains was specified in PVS and its correctness was
formalized. Thus verifying that the rings of integers and the Gaussian
integers are Euclidean domains provides a straightforward manner to
infer the correctness of this algorithm for both structures.  Another
example concerns quaternions. It is well known that Hamilton's
quaternions mimic any 3D rotation.  However, specifying quaternion
structures using any arbitrary field as a parameter allows not only
the verification of the completeness of three-dimensional rotations
but also a simple specification of Hurwitz quaternions, which can be
used to give an alternative proof of the well-known Lagrange's
four-square theorem.  This talk will discuss the main recent
developments of the PVS theory algebra, highlighting the benefits of
its general abstract discipline of formalization by exploring as a
case study the use of Hurwitz Rings, the First Isomorphism Theorem for
rings and the characterization of algebraic properties that lead to
constructing quaternions as division rings to establish Lagrange's
four-square theorem.-->

<!--An Indexer and Query Language for Libraries written in
LambdaPi/Dedukti, Claudio Sacerdoti Coen: The libraries exported from
various mathematical tools to Dedukti/LambdaPi poses peculiar
challenges to indexing and retrieval. In particular the libraries are
heterogeneous because "the same" statements and definitions can be
encoded in different ways according to the encoding of the logic they
are written in. Moreover the same statement can appear in various
forms because of user defined rewriting rules. We will present an
indexing tool and query language integrated in LambdaPi that addresses
the previous challenges and also allows limited search up-to
alignments. -->
