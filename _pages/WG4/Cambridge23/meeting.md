This joint WG4-WG5 meeting consists of:

- a Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics [(NatFoM)(https://cicm-conference.org/2023/cicm.php?event=natfom&menu=general)] (September 6-7).

- a Workshop on Libraries of Formal Proofs and Natural Mathematical Language (September 7-8).

The session on September 7 is common to the two workshops.

## Overall programme

| Day and time | Session |
| 6 September 14:00-18:00 | Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics |
| 7 September 14:00-18:00 | Joint session between the two workshops |
| 8 September 14:00-18:00 | Workshop on Libraries of Formal Proofs and Natural Mathematical Language|

## Venue

These two workshops happen during the [16th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics](https://cicm-conference.org/2023/) which takes place at Emmanuel College, St Andrew's St, 15 minutes away by bus, 35 minutes away by walk, and 10 minutes away by bike.

## NatFoM: Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics

In (pure) mathematics there has always existed a strong informal sense of "naturality" of topics and methods. Generally "natural" theories, notions, properties, or proofs are prefered over technical, convoluted, or counterintuitive approaches. If formal mathematics is to become part of mainstream mathematics, its formalizations and usage apparently have to become more "natural", and thus closer to informal mathematics.

This workshop broadly addresses the issue of naturality in formal mathematics. On 7 September there will be a joint afternoon session with the Workshop on Libraries of Formal Proofs and Natural Mathematical Language. We plan on open discussions on naturalness in formal mathematics.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
  * The notion of naturality in mathematics generally
  * Natural mathematical language
  * Translations between informal and formal mathematics using deep learning or classical techniques
  * Natural input and output languages for formal mathematics systems
  * Controlled natural languages (CNL) for mathematics
  * Making formal mathematics documents readable
  * Naturality of foundational theories (types, sets, HOL, ...)
  * Naturality of proof methods
  * Natural proof structures and granularities
  * Natural structurings of formalized mathematical texts and libraries
  * Mathematical type setting (LaTeX) and formal mathematics
  * Natural formalizations

At least one author of each accepted extended abstract/demonstration proposal is expected to attend NatFoM and to presents his/her submission in person. Accepted abstracts will be made available online ([one column ceur-ws](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/samplestyles/onecolceurws.sty)).

**Program Committee:**
  * Adrian De Lon, Bonn (co-chair)
  * Peter Koepke, Bonn (co-chair)
  * Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki, Cambridge
  * Dennis Müller, Erlangen (co-chair)

## Workshop on Libraries of Formal Proofs and Natural Mathematical Language, 7-8 September 2023

We welcome contributions (in the form of short talks, demos or presentations on work in progress) on the topics of library descriptions or on methodologies, algorithms and tools trying to tackle the challenges raised by the development, maintenance, refactoring and search of libraries of formal proofs.

We especially welcome contributions focussing on the role of natural language for formal proof libraries, in a very broad sense: natural language processing as a tool to tackle the aforementioned challenges; libraries of formal proofs as training data for large language models and autoformalisation; bridging the gap between formal mathematics and natural language mathematics.

Accepted abstracts will be made available online.

Please note that talks will be in person, therefore at least one author of each accepted submission is expected to attend the workshop and to present the submission in person.

Funding can be offered to some participants who are members of EuroProofNet ([membership application](https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply) is free).

Before applying check the [reimbursement rules](../reimbursement-rules). The daily allowance has been fixed at 175 euros.

For funding applications you need to provide an estimation in EUROS of your transport to Cambridge with screen capture as proof, and with the date of your arrival in Cambridge and the date of your departure from Cambridge (it is possible to arrive a few days before and leave a few days after the workshop but a maximum de 4.4 daily allowance will be reimbursed).

If you want to give a talk or if you want to apply for funding, fill out the [Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSv1lE3nk0eIcPvQMVqCKCpe_1yMIQFTNaMHuAtEUbIdi93A/viewform?usp=pp_url).
