## July 6, 2024

Co-located with the Workshop for [Women in Formal Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/him/programs/special-events/women-in-formal-math) as part of the [trimester on Prospects of Formalized Math](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/future-programs/future-trimester-programs/prospects-of-formal-mathematics/description/) at the Hausdorff Institute of Mathematics, there will be a half-day event dedicated to gender balance in the community.
The event will consist of an invited talk and a few contributed talks by women to promote their research and improve their visibility. 
The talks will be followed by a discussion on gender balance issues, subconscious biases that occur and what we can do to improve the situation.

**People of all genders are invited to participate in the event and the discussion**.

### Booklet of best practices
Within the cost action European Network For Gender Balance in Informatics ([EUGAIN](https://eugain.eu/)) a [Booklet “From Ph.D. to Professor”](https://eugain.eu/results/deliverables/) of best practices was developed to address some of the gender balance issues, particularly in the stage between PhD and professorship. The booklet is going to be updated during the life of the EUGAIN action.
We will consider some of those practices during the discussion part of the event.
