## July 31, 2023

Co-located with [ITP 2023](https://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/ITP2023/), there will be a half-day event dedicated to gender balance in the community.
The event will consist of an invited talk and a few contributed talks by women to promote their research and improve their visibility. The talks will be followed by a discussion on gender balance issues, subconscious biases that occur and what we can do to improve the situation.

**People of all genders are invited to participate in the event and the discussion**.

## Important dates

* Abstract submission: ~~June 2 2023~~ June 9 2023
* Author notification: June 12 2023
* Funding application deadline: ~~June 26 2023~~ July 16 2023
* Early registration deadline: June 30, 2023

## Invited Speaker

## Call for contributions

* Abstract submission deadline: ~~June 2 2023~~ June 9 2023
* Author notification: June 12 2023

The contributed talks are meant as a platform to disseminate research done by women in the community. Only women (including transgender women) are invited to submit a contributed talk.
Submissions should consist of a title and a 1-2 pages abstract, in pdf format, via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wepn2023).

Considering the broad background of the expected audience, we encourage authors to include information of pedagogical value in their abstract, such as motivation and context of their work.

### Booklet of best practices

Within the cost action European Network For Gender Balance in Informatics ([EUGAIN](https://eugain.eu/)) a [Booklet “From Ph.D. to Professor”](https://eugain.eu/results/deliverables/) of best practices was developed to address some of the gender balance issues, particularly in the stage between PhD and professorship. The booklet is going to be updated during the life of the EUGAIN action.
We will consider some of those practices during the discussion part of the event.
