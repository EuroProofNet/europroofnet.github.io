## June 5-6, 2025
The Workshop on Reasoning with Quantitative Types is a two day event, supported by the European Research Network on Formal Proofs.  Intersection types were introduced near the end of the 1970s to overcome the limitations of Curry's type assignment system and to provide a characterization of the strongly normalizing terms of the Lambda Calculus. The non-idempotent type discipline, introduced almost two decades later, was inspired by linear logic and has since been considered as an adequate model to reason about resources. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers who are currently developing theory and applications in this area, to foster their interaction and provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, as well as to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this field.

## Invited Speakers
- Delia Kesner 
- Andrej Dudenhefner
- Beniamino Accattoli

## Call for contributed talks
* Submission deadline: April 28, 2025
* Author notification:  May 4, 2025

The workshop is going to be an informal event and both original and previously submitted works will be considered.
Contributed talks should be supported by a small abstract of 1 page. Please use the EasyChair style for formatting your submission [(EasyChair Style Guidelines)](https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors). Abstracts will not be peer-reviewed, but only those that are relevant and of good quality will be considered. Submit your abstracts as a PDF file via email to (sandra@fc.up.pt) before the submission deadline on April 28, 2025 (anywhere on Earth).
