# Aims

Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be very successful in programming and translation tasks, and creates new opportunities combining AI with proofs. Recently, various claims have been made that large language models (LLMs) will revolutionise these areas. However, many questions about the details of the applications of LLMs and their impact on theorem proving and mathematics remain open. At the workshop, we want to bring together researchers from a wide range of communities: mathematics, automated and interactive theorem proving, machine learning, natural language processing, and formal methods, in order to discuss the state-of-the-art and future directions for this new area of research.

Examples of topics that we intend to discuss include, but are not limited to:

- **ML/LLM for Advancing Proof Techniques**, e.g., tailoring LLMs to theorem-proving datasets and benchmarks, combining neural networks and symbolic reasoning for robust theorem proving, enabling LLMs to learn proof techniques from minimal data or prior examples.

- **Applications of ML/LLM in Theorem Proving**, e.g., designing co-pilot systems for theorem provers like Coq, Lean, or Isabelle, auto-formalising mathematical concepts and proofs from textbooks or research papers, human-machine collaboration workflows in proof construction.

- **Challenges and Limitations of ML/LLM in Theorem Proving**, e.g. addressing hallucinations and errors in proofs generated by LLMs, handling large and complex proof spaces with LLM-guided tools, mitigating biases introduced during LLM training on specific mathematical domains.

- **Benchmarks and Evaluation for ML/LLM in Theorem Proving**, e.g., creating datasets specifically for evaluating LLM-based theorem proving systems, assessing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM-generated proofs, defining success metrics for proof assistance beyond correctness, such as creativity and accessibility.

- **Interdisciplinary Impact of ML/LLM**, e.g., leveraging LLMs to teach formal methods, logic, and theorem proving to students, using LLMs to explore conjectures and new areas of mathematical research, applications in formal verification for software, hardware, and systems engineering, including industrial applications.

- **Future Directions for ML/LLM in theorem proving**: e.g.,  the implications of relying on AI systems for critical mathematical proofs, setting open standards for the integration of LLMs in the theorem-proving workflows, speculating on the evolution of LLMs and their roles in formal reasoning.

- **Cross-Domain Connections**: e.g., developing user-friendly natural language interfaces for proof assistants, adapting LLM capabilities from general domains to formal logic and proofs.

The workshop features 27 contributions, a panel discussion and a poster session. We are proud to have three invited speakers:
- *Formal Mathematical Reasoning: A New Frontier for Large Language Models*: [Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/) (UT Austin and Google Deepmind)
- *Machine Learning for Mathematics Research*: [Sergei Gukov](http://theory.caltech.edu/~gukov/) (Caltech & Dublin Inst. Adv. Studies)
- *Machine Learning in Theorem Proving*: [Josef Urban](https://people.ciirc.cvut.cz/~urbanjo3/) (CIIRC/CVUT)

A detailed schedule is available via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/smart-program/EuroProofNet-WG5/).

# Registration
We are expecting a large number of participants, and therefore registration is **mandatory**. Registration is [online](https://www.epay.ed.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/college-of-science-and-engineering/school-of-informatics/informatics-events/workshop-on-theorem-proving-and-machine-learning-in-the-age-of-llms), and will close on the 12th March 2025 at 1600 UK time.

## Workshop Dinner
There is an optional workshop dinner at the [Surgeon's Hall](https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/) at a cost of Â£63 per person.
You may, if you like, invite an additional guest at extra cost.
These options will be available at the time of registration.

# Location

[Postgraduate Centre Heriot-Watt](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vBKoBeCjZBNVnqeb9), Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, EH14 4AL, UK. More information about the campus from [Heriot-Watt](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/edinburgh/maps-directions.htm).

# Publication plans
The chairs are investigating the possibility of organising a special journal issue dedicated to the topics of this workshop, at the J. of Annals of Mathematics and AI. Further details will be discussed at the time of the workshop.
