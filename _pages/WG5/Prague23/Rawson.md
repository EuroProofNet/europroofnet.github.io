Deployment of neural networks in general is well-studied, but theorem
proving has its idiosyncrasies and domain-specific requirements.
Various performance metrics and constraints must be considered. Failure
to do so means the next generation of theorem provers will continue to
be beaten by the incumbent systems. Luckily, I have a bag of tricks for
you...
