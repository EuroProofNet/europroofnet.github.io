**Prototype implementation of the mathematical framework, with basic user interface, user documentation and gallery of examples of type theories.**

- [Andromeda](https://www.andromeda-prover.org/), a proof checker for user-definable dependently-typed theories

- [Narya](https://github.com/gwaithimirdain/narya), a proof assistant for higher-dimensional type theory

- [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi), a proof assistant for dependent type theory modulo user-defined rewriting rules
