**Database gathering proofs from the proof systems Coq, HOL-Light and Matita, and their translations.**

The proofs translated to Dedukti, and from Dedukti to other provers, are not gathered into a single database but are scattered on several places to ease their integration in target systems:

- [Nubo](https://github.com/Deducteam/nubo/) is a set of metadata and scripts to download and check Dedukti libraries. It contains links to a number of proof libraries translated to Dedukti: the arithmetic library of Matita, some part of the Coq library GeoCoq on geometry, the OpenTheory library, some proofs generated by some old version of the veriT SMT prover, some proofs generated by some old version of the ZenonModulo theorem prover, some proofs from the Isabelle/HOL standard library.

- [Logipedia](http://logipedia.inria.fr/) is a browsable website providing a library of arithmetic theorems in various systems: Matita, Coq, Lean, PVS, OpenTheory, Dedukti. It has been obtained by translating the Matita arithmetic library to Dedukti and then to the other systems using [STTfaXport](https://github.com/Deducteam/sttfaxport).

- [matita\_lib\_in\_agda](https://github.com/thiagofelicissimo/matita_lib_in_agda) is a translation of the Matita arithmetic library into Agda using [predicativize](https://github.com/Deducteam/predicativize).

- [coq-hol-light](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light) is a translation in Rocq of the HOL-Light library [Multivariate](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/blob/master/Multivariate/make_complex.ml), which contains more than 20,000 theorems on real and complex analysis, and has been obtained by using [hol2dk](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk) and [lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi).

- [coq-hol-light-Logic2](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light-Logic2) is a translation in Rocq of the HOL-Light [Logic](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/blob/master/Logic/make.ml) library.
