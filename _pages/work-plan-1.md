* 20% of the budget will be dedicated to short-term scientific missions (STSMs). STSMs are a very important tool for the action since the development of tools for interoperability is facilitated when people can meet and work together at the same place. A call for STSM proposals will be launched soon.

* For the first year, some schools will be (co-)organized to give EuroProofNet members the knowledge necessary to work on the objectives of the action:

    - On June 24-25, at Nantes (France), in co-location with the [TYPES'22](https://types22.inria.fr/) conference, there will be a school on [Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/) and the encoding of proofs of various systems in Dedukti, and a workshop on Women in EuroProofNet.

    - During the summer, there will be the next edition of VTSA at Saarbrücken (Germany) with a focus on proof-generating verification systems.

    - In September, there will be a school on [Naproche](https://naproche.github.io/) and controlled natural languages in proof assistants at Bonn (Germany). 

* Finally, a number of small and big meetings have been planned:

    - On February 10-11, the [kick-off meeting of the WG3](wg3-meeting1) on program verification at Valencia (Spain).

    - At the end of March, a WG6 meeting on syntax and semantics of type theory at Stockholm (Sweden).

    - In August, during [FLOC](https://www.floc2022.org/) at Haifa (Israel), a WG2 meeting co-located with the PAAR workshop and a workshop dedicated to sharing libraries of formal proofs.

    - On September 4-7, the [AITP'22](http://aitp-conference.org/2022/) conference at Aussois (France).
