EuroProofNet is the European research network on digital proofs.
**EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of
proof systems**.
It is a [COST](http://cost.eu) action started on November 2021
gathering more than [578 researchers](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA20111/#tabs+Name:Working%20Groups%20and%20Membership) from 47 different countries, chaired by [Frédéric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) and a [Core group](../contact).
EuroProofNet organizes meetings and schools (see coming events below), and provides
[grants](../grants) to its members for short-term scientific missions
in another country. [Learn more...](../description) &nbsp; [Objectives](../objectives) &nbsp; [Deliverables](../deliverables) &nbsp; [Questions?](../contact)

To join the action, simply
[apply](https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply)
to the [working groups](../wg) you are interested in (it is free and open to anyone interested by proof systems)!

The EuroProofNet website provides also many useful information about
[proof tools](../tools), [research groups](../groups), third-party
[schools](../schools) and [conferences](../conferences), [job
offers](../jobs), [teaching](../teaching) material and websites,
useful links on [gender](../gender-balance) balance issues,
etc. (check the tabs on the top and the menu icon on the top right
corner).

**Sad news:**

<img src="https://deducteam.gitlabpages.inria.fr/img/gilles.jpg" width="50%"/>

EuroProofNet is sad to announce that [Gilles Dowek](https://lsv.ens-paris-saclay.fr/~dowek/), founder of [Deducteam](https://deducteam.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) and the [Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/) logical framework, which plays a central role in EuroProofNet, died on 21 July 2025 at 58 years old. He was vice leader of the WG4 on proof libraries from 2021 to 2022. He made important contributions not only in logic (unification, automated theorem proving, type theory) but also in quantum programming languages and philosophy. He received several awards from the French Academy of Sciences. He was a brilliant speaker and teacher, and published several books in computer science, logic and philosophy. He has been very active in promoting the teaching of computer science in high school and contributed to the definition of the corresponding cursus. Finally, he supervised or co-supervised many PhD students.
