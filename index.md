EuroProofNet is the European research network on digital proofs.
**EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of
proof systems**.
It is a [COST](http://cost.eu) action started on November 2021
gathering more than [500 researchers](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA20111/#tabs+Name:Working%20Groups%20and%20Membership) from 44 different countries, chaired by [Frédéric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) and a [Core group](../contact).
EuroProofNet organizes [meetings and schools](../events), and provides
[grants](../grants) to its members for short-term scientific missions
in another country. [Learn more...](../description) &nbsp; [Objectives](../objectives) &nbsp; [Deliverables](../deliverables) &nbsp; [Questions?](../contact)

To join the action, simply
[apply](https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply)
to the [working groups](../wg) you are interested in (it is free and open to anyone interested by proof systems)!

The EuroProofNet website provides also many useful information about
[proof tools](../tools), [research groups](../groups), third-party
[schools](../schools) and [conferences](../conferences), [job
offers](../jobs), [teaching](../teaching) material and websites,
useful links on [gender](../gender-balance) balance issues,
etc. (check the tabs on the top and the menu icon on the top right
corner).
