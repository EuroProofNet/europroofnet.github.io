title: <del>Syntax-Semantics of Simply Typed Theory of Acyclic Algorithms</del> (cancelled)
---

In 1989, Moschovakis [1] initiated a new theory of the mathematical notion of algorithm, within untyped, full recursion. In 2006, Moschovakis [2] introduced the formal language of higher-order  Type-Theory of Acyclic Algorithms (TTAR) via simple types, which models the notion of algorithm and concepts of meaning in simply-typed semantic structures. The focus of [2] is on computations that end up after finite number of steps. The approach, in its varieties, with full and acyclic recursion, provides for new developments of type theory of computation and new applications to computational syntax-semantics interfaces in programming and natural languages.

In this talk, I present the formal language (LAR) of TTAR, by extending it with a restrictor operator that sets conditions on denotations of terms. In addition, the operator defines restricted memory and parameters. TTAR provides two kinds of semantics of the formal language LAR, denotational and algorithmic. The reduction system of TTAR is essential for the notion of algorithm and syntax-semantics interfaces. I shall overview the reduction calculus and some of the theoretical results of TTAR.
