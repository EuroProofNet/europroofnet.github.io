title: Towards behavioural types as coalgebras
---

Category theoretical approaches have been fruitful in the investigation of type theories and their syntax, but typically syntax is treated inductively via algebras. In this talk, I would like to discuss how session types and context-free session types can be approached via coalgebras, which allows us to handle elegantly problems via coalgebraic techniques that purely syntactic approaches render more opaque. Using coalgebra to deal with the syntax of session types may lead the way to a coinductive treatment of general behavioural types and the corresponding logics.
