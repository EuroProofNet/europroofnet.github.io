The theory of classifying toposes is a crucial feature of what makes the Elephant what it is: A powerful environment for varying mathematical expressions of related ideas to converge to a single concept. Particularly, it allows to manage the intricate world of continuously varying algebraic structures over topological spaces by way of the thoroughly organized syntax of symbolic logic. 

As of yet, an according theory of classifying infinity-toposes has not been developed for various obstructive reasons. With this ultimate goal in mind, in this talk I propose a canonical sheaf theory for geometric infinity-categories; here, the notion of geometric
infinity-category generalizes Anel and Joyal's definition of infinity-logoi in straight-forward fashion. I do so by moving away from the classical sheaf condition over topological spaces — and over geometric categories more generally — and introduce a stronger limit-
preserving property instead. We will see that the according higher geometric sheaves differ from the ordinary ones only by a subtle cotopological fragment. Yet it turns out that this fragment is crucial in various aspects. As a case in point, I show that every infinity-topos is the theory of higher geometric sheaves over itself, and that the same is generally not true for the ordinary geometric sheaves over itself.

Concerning this workshop, I would be particularly interested in discussions on whether or not the associated higher covers are the right way to think about — and eventually obtain — a notion of geometric HoTT's, in such a way that these higher geometric sheaf theories present classifying infinity-toposes for them.
