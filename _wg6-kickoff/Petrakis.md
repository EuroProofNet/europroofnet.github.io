title: Positive negation in constructive mathematics
---

In standard constructive logic negation is treated as in classical logic in a negativistic and weak way. This is in contrast to the use of a positive and strong “or” and “exists”. In constructive mathematics however, we often find a positive and strong approach to negatively defined concepts,  like that of inequality. This fact motivates a clear distinction between a positive and strong negation and the standard weak negation. Bringing together older ideas of Griss and Nelson and recent work of Shulman and ours, we investigate the role of a positive and strong negation in Bishop-style constructive mathematics.
