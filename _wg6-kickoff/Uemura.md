title: Normalization for initial space-valued models of type theories
---

Given a type theory, one can construct its initial set-valued model but also its initial space-valued model. The coherence problem asks if the initial space-valued model is actually set-valued. If this is the case, then the initial set-valued model admits a unique morphism to an arbitrary space-valued model, which allows us to interpret the type theory in higher structures.

We develop a normalization technique for the initial space-valued model to solve the coherence problem. Once we have proved that every type or term in the initial space-valued model has a unique normal form, calculation of the path spaces of the initial space-valued model is reduced to calculation of the path spaces between normal forms. The space of normal forms is defined as an (non-higher) inductive type in a certain ∞-topos, so its path spaces are easy to calculate.

Our normalization technique is a higher-dimensional version of normalization by evaluation. This is possible thanks to Bocquet, Kaposi, and Sattler's relative induction principle and Sterling's synthetic Tait computability. The relative induction principle gives us a definition of the category of renamings suitable for ∞-categorical generalization. The idea of synthetic Tait computability is to use extensional type theory as an internal language for glued 1-topoi to construct logical predicates. Its higher analogue is to use homotopy type theory as an internal language for glued ∞-topoi to construct logical predicates.
