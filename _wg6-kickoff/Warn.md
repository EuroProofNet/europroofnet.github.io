title: Effective quotients in homotopy type theory
---

For a type X, one expects that surjections from X correspond to ‘higher equivalence relations’ on X.  A priori this idea is difficult to express internally to type theory since it involves an infinite tower of coherences. In this talk, we give an internal definition of higher equivalence relations and show it to be equivalent to surjections out of X. As an application we obtain a simple proof of the stabilisation theorem for higher groups.
