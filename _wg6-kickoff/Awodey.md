title: Kripke-Joyal forcing for Martin-LÃ¶f type theory
---

I will report on recent joint work with Nicola Gambino and Sina Hazratpour, generalizing the Kripke-Joyal forcing semantics of topos theory from IFOL and IHOL to MLTT, contained in the paper [arXiv:2110.14576](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14576).
