title: B-systems and C-systems are equivalent
---

C-systems were defined by Cartmell as models of generalized algebraic theories. B-systems were defined by Voevodsky in his quest to formulate and prove an initiality theorem for type theories. I will speak about a joint work with Benedikt Ahrens, Paige Randall North and Egbert Rijke where we prove Voevodsky’s conjecture that the categories of B-systems and of C-systems are equivalent. We do so by specialising a more general equivalence between non-stratified versions of B-systems and C-systems, which we name E-systems and CE-systems, respectively.
