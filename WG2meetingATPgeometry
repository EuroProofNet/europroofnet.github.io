This joint WG2 meeting is dedicated to the study of  Rule based prover for geometry

- Presentation of current systems JGEx (Zoltán Kovács); OGPCP-GDDM (Pedro Quaresma); Larus (Vesna Marinkovic)

- Criteria for the construction of good set of rules (Jelena Markovic)

- Validation of the set of rules by Automatic provers and proof assistants (Julien Narboux)

Following some small presentations an open discussion will address this issues.

The goal is to set the basis for the preparation of a meta-prover
capable of accepting different set of rules, formally verified to be
consistence and sound, and with natural languages and geometric
renderings and capable to be integrated in a dynamic geometry system
